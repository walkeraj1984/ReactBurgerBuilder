# ReactBurgerBuilder

This was an app created in a project based course By Maximillian and Academind teaching ReactJS from the ground level to master level and beyond. Fully implemented with React-Redux and while the course teaches new v16.8 "hooks", they are not implemented in this copy.

To use this app in a development environment of your own, clone the repository on your own local machine, open the cloned source folder in a terminal window and type "npm install" to install all development dependencies. Then after the install is complete, you may run it with "npm start"

If you want to just see the app running, you may visit my deployed copy at https://react-my-burger-26dde.web.app/. Feel free to create new Authentication credentials for your own profile to mess around with.
