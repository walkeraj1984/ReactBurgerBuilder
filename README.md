# ReactBurgerBuilder

This was an app created in a project based course By Maximillian and Academind teaching ReactJS from the ground level to master level and beyond. Fully implemented with React-Redux and while the course teaches new v16.8 "hooks", they are not implemented in this copy.

To use this app in a development environment of your own, clone the repository and in the cloned folder on your own local machine, open the source folder in a terminal window and type npm install to install all dev dependencies. Then run it with npm start
